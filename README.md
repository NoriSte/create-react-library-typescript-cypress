# create-react-library-typescript-cypress

I created this repo to play with

- [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library)
- [cypress-react-unit-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

You can see the end result in the [react-crypto-compare repo](https://github.com/NoriSte/react-crypto-compare)
